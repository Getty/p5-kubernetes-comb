=description

An upstream is where a Comb borrows its service from instead of running it
itself. L<Kubernetes::Comb/reconcile> accepts as upstream any object doing
this role, and builds one from the short forms (C<< K8s => (...) >>,
C<< '+Full::Class' => (...) >>) and from C<spec.upstream> of the custom
resource -- the arguments go to C<new>, so an upstream class takes the keys
the custom resource names as its constructor arguments.

The Comb is not a constructor argument: every method gets it as its first
argument, so the upstream can take the Comb's namespace, name and client from
it.

=method status

  my $seen = $upstream->status($comb)->get;

Future of a hashref:

=over

=item reachable

Whether the upstream can be used at all. False makes the Comb C<Blocked>,
with C<message> as the reason. An upstream reports unreachability this way,
not by failing: a failed Future makes the Comb C<Error>.

=item phase

The phase the upstream reports for itself; the Comb is C<Running> only while
it is C<Running>.

=item via

Optional arrayref of the layers the service is borrowed through, nearest
first -- for a chain C<[ 'dev', 'prod' ]>.

=item context

Optional kube context of the upstream, recorded in C<status.upstream>.

=item message

Optional, human-readable: why it is unreachable, or what else there is to
know.

=back

=method endpoints

  my $endpoints = $upstream->endpoints($comb)->get;

Future of an arrayref of L<Kubernetes::Comb::Endpoint>: what the upstream
offers under which name. The upstream decides which address is reachable:
C<cluster> is the address to use from inside the Comb's cluster (the one the
bridge points at), C<external> the one from outside. Without C<cluster> the
Comb uses C<external> from inside too.

=method replicate_into

  $upstream->replicate_into($comb)->get;

Optional. Called with the Comb on every L<Kubernetes::Comb/reconcile> step
that borrows from the upstream, before the bridge is deployed, to replicate
data into it. May return a Future; a failure makes the Comb C<Error>.
